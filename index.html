    <h1>About the Creators</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to prevent people from placing items that could be recyclable if people knew that you have to clean certain products before you recycle them, or that you need to recycle items seperatly if it's something like a plastic container. Since a lot of people aren't aware of these recycling rules, only 5-6% of items taht are recyled each year are actually able to be recycled. </p>
